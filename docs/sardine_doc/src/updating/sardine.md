# Sardine

This section is about fixing errors in Sardine's playing environment.

## UVLoop is not installed

UVLoop is not available on Windows. If you are running Windows, this message will pop-up everytime
you start Sardine. Don't worry too much about it!

## The `d` or `D` objects are not found

* Make sure that you turned on `SuperDirt Handlers` in `sardine-config`-config`.

## The `zd` or `zn` objects are not available (Ziffers)

* Ziffers must be installed separately from Sardine. 
* Install the `ziffers-python` package.
